                            bikes, this often makes a process more efficient. But specific data or statistics about
                            these savings are not available to residents or visitors. Why not? Could
                            radical openness also advance the debate about the use of this technology and lead to new

                            Now that parking enforcement is being carried out by a parking scanner car instead of an
                            officer on the street, there's no one around to ask questions. The officer is currently in
                            the office, at the computer. In between, they have to wait long periods
                            until new photos of a potential illegal parker appear. Can the officer answer questions at
                            the same time? Could we set up a helpdesk for people with urgent questions?

                        <p>
                            People often think they're being filmed when they see cameras. Sometimes they wave at them.
                            Usually, photos are taken as soon as an object is detected. So, no video clips are saved,
                            and no one is watching live. To make this clear, you can make it visible
                            when a photo is being taken. For example, with a light or an opening aperture. It's
                            important that the "signal" is clearly visible in daylight, or in the case of a parking
                            sensor, on a passing object.

                            Street cameras often point in one direction, but that's not the case on a parking scanner
                            car. They're even somewhat hidden. The camera box on the car thus becomes a kind of
                            "all-seeing eye"—but of course, that's not the case. Could we better communicate
                            its operation by adjusting the shape of the camera box?

                            Municipal technology projects are often only released to the public once they're completely
                            finished. That's understandable; you don't want to make a blunder. But there's also value in
                            presenting an unfinished product to the public. By presenting a mock-up
                            as early as possible, you can learn how people perceive the product and what they think it
                            does. You can then adjust the design accordingly. A conversation on the street can also
                            offer new perspectives: for example, does it
                            also work well for the elderly? Or for people in wheelchairs?

                        <p>
                            In a digital system like the parking scanner car, every exception must be coded. For some
                            exceptions, this isn't a problem because they're common. Consider, for example, people who
                            park and pay five minutes later. Such an exception is built into the algorithm.
                            But there are also exceptional situations where you receive a fine, even though most people
                            actually think it's unnecessary. In these situations, you could say that the human touch is
                            missing. We organized a quiz where a group
                            of people voted on the justification of a fine. Could such a human feedback loop also become
                            part of the digitalized process?
