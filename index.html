                    <h2>Share open statistics</h2>
                    <p>When cameras with image recognition are deployed, for example, in parking scan cars or
                        scanning bicycles,
                        this often makes a process more efficient. But specific data or statistics about these savings
                        are not available to residents or visitors. Why not? Could radical openness also advance the
                        debate
                        about the use of this technology and lead to new insights among the public?

                    <p>Now that parking enforcement is being carried out by a parking scanner car instead of an
                        enforcement
                        officer on the street, there's
                        no one around to ask questions. The enforcement officer is currently in the office, at the
                        computer.
                        In
                        between, he has to wait long periods until new photos of a potential illegal parker appear. Can
                        the
                        enforcement officer answer questions at the same time? Could we set up a helpdesk for people
                        with
                        pressing
                        questions?

                    <p>People often think they're being filmed when they see cameras. Sometimes they wave at them.
                        Usually,
                        photos are taken as soon as an object is recognized. So no video clips are saved, and no one is
                        watching live. To make this clear, you can make it visible when a photo is being taken.
                        For example, with a light or an opening aperture. It's important that the "signal" is clearly
                        visible in daylight, or in the case of a parking scanner, on a passing object.</p>

                    <p>Street cameras often point in one direction, but that's not the case on a parking scanner car.
                        They're even a bit hidden. The camera box on the car becomes a kind of "all-seeing eye": but
                        that's
                        of course not the case. Could we communicate its operation better by adjusting the shape of the
                        camera box?

                        in the city.

                        For example, consider a scale model that everyone can walk around to assess the plan's impact.
                        Such
                        formats don't exist for digital changes in the city, even though these

                        types of plans can also have an impact on public space. Can you create a digital scale model for
                        participatory meetings about (invisible) technology in the city?

                    <h2>Take to the streets!</h2>
                    <p>Municipal technology projects are often only released to the public once they are completely
                        finished. That is logical; you don't want to make a blunder. But there's also value in
                        presenting an
                        unfinished
                        product to the public. By presenting a mock-up as early as possible, you can learn how
                        people
                        see
                        the product
                        and what they think it does. You can then adjust the design accordingly. A conversation on
                        the
                        street can also provide you with new perspectives: for example, does it also work well for
                        the
                        elderly?
                        Or for people in wheelchairs?

                    <h2>Value cards</h2>
                    <p>Coalition agreements, policy documents, and implementation agendas often describe
                        ambitions and
                        public values that apply to the use of technology in the city. During a participatory
                        meeting,
                        you
                        ask for feedback from residents. It would be helpful if residents clearly identified
                        these
                        democratically agreed-upon values, so that it is clear how the proposal should be
                        assessed. The
                        value cards are a useful tool for this.

                    <h2>Determining human scale</h2>
                    <p>In a digital system like the parking scanner car, every exception must be coded. For
                        some
                        exceptions, this isn't a problem because they occur frequently. Consider, for
                        example, people
                        who
                        park and only pay 5 minutes later. Such an exception is built into the algorithm.
                        But there are
                        also
                        exceptional situations in which you receive a fine, while most people actually think
                        it is
                        unnecessary.
                        In these situations, you could say: the human touch is missing. We organized a quiz,
                        where a
                        group of people votes on the justification of a fine. Could such a human feedback
                        loop also
                        become part of the digitized process?
